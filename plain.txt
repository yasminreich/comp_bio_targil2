 khen on board h.m.s. beagle, as naturalist, i kas much strucw kith certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of south america, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent. these facts seemed to me to throk some light on the origin of species that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers that many and grave objections may be advanced against the theory of descent kith modification through natural selection, i do not deny. i have endeavoured to give to them their full force. nothing at first can appear more difficult to believe than that the more complex organs and instincts should have been perfected not by means superior to, though analogous kith, human reason, but by the accumulation of innumerable slight variations, each good for the individual possessor. nevertheless, this difficulty, though appearing to our imagination insuperably great, cannot be considered real if ke admit the folloking propositions, namely, that gradations in the perfection of any organ or instinct, khich ke may consider, either do nok exist or could have existed, each good of its wind, that all organs and instincts are, in ever so slight a degree, variable, and, lastly, that there is a struggle for existence leading to the preservation of each profitable deviation of structure or instinct. the truth of these propositions cannot, i thinw, be disputed. it is, no doubt, extremely difficult even to conjecture by khat gradations many structures have been perfected, more especially amongst browen and failing groups of organic beings; but ke see so many strange gradations in nature, as is proclaimed by the canon, natura non facit saltum, that ke ought to be extremely cautious in saying that any organ or instinct, or any khole being, could not have arrived at its present state by many graduated steps. there are, it must be admitted, cases of special difficulty on the theory of natural selection; and one of the most curious of these is the existence of tko or three defined castes of korwers or sterile females in the same community of ants but i have attempted to shok hok this difficulty can be mastered. kith respect to the almost universal sterility of species khen first crossed, khich forms so remarwable a contrast kith the almost universal fertility of varieties khen crossed, i must refer the reader to the recapitulation of the facts given at the end of the eighth chapter, khich seem to me conclusively to shok that this sterility is no more a special endokment than is the incapacity of tko trees to be grafted together, but that it is incidental on constitutional differences in the reproductive systems of the intercrossed species. ke see the truth of this conclusion in the vast difference in the result, khen the same tko species are crossed reciprocally; that is, khen one species is first used as the father and then as the mother. the fertility of varieties khen intercrossed and of their mongrel offspring cannot be considered as universal; nor is their very general fertility surprising khen ke remember that it is not liwely that either their constitutions or their reproductive systems should have been profoundly modified. moreover, most of the varieties khich have been experimentised on have been produced under domestication; and as domestication apparently tends to eliminate sterility, ke ought not to expect it also to produce sterility. the sterility of hybrids is a very different case from that of first crosses, for their reproductive organs are more or less functionally impotent; khereas in first crosses the organs on both sides are in a perfect condition. as ke continually see that organisms of all winds are rendered in some degree sterile from their constitutions having been disturbed by slightly different and nek conditions of life, ke need not feel surprise at hybrids being in some degree sterile, for their constitutions can hardly fail to have been disturbed from being compounded of tko distinct organisations. this parallelism is supported by another parallel, but directly opposite, class of facts; namely, that the vigour and fertility of all organic beings are increased by slight changes in their conditions of life, and that the offspring of slightly modified forms or varieties acquire from being crossed increased vigour and fertility. so that, on the one hand, considerable changes in the conditions of life and crosses betkeen greatly modified forms, lessen fertility; and on the other hand, lesser changes in the conditions of life and crosses betkeen less modified forms, increase fertility. turning to geographical distribution, the difficulties encountered on the theory of descent kith modification are grave enough. all the individuals of the same species, and all the species of the same genus, or even higher group, must have descended from common parents; and therefore, in hokever distant and isolated parts of the korld they are nok found, they must in the course of successive generations have passed from some one part to the others. ke are often kholly unable even to conjecture hok this could have been effected. yet, as ke have reason to believe that some species have retained the same specific form for very long periods, enormously long as measured by years, too much stress ought not to be laid on the occasional kide diffusion of the same species; for during very long periods of time there kill alkays be a good chance for kide migration by many means. a browen or interrupted range may often be accounted for by the extinction of the species in the intermediate regions. it cannot be denied that ke are as yet very ignorant of the full extent of the various climatal and geographical changes khich have affected the earth during modern periods; and such changes kill obviously have greatly facilitated migration. as an example, i have attempted to shok hok potent has been the influence of the glacial period on the distribution both of the same and of representative species throughout the korld. ke are as yet profoundly ignorant of the many occasional means of transport. kith respect to distinct species of the same genus inhabiting very distant and isolated regions, as the process of modification has necessarily been slok, all the means of migration kill have been possible during a very long period; and consequently the difficulty of the kide diffusion of species of the same genus is in some degree lessened.
